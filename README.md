# Book-Search-App

•	For this project we developed an application that finds the title, authors, and isbn13 for books by searching for keywords in book titles.
•	I created a Java script to scrape a CSV file containing over 10000 books and their subsequent background information.
•	Utilized Hash tables to use the title of the book as the key to connect it with its subsequent information as its value.
